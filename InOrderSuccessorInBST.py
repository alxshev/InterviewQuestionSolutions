# Problem: Given a BST,  and a reference to a Node x in the BST, 
#  find the Inorder Successor of the given node in the BST.

# Idea: inorder traversal
# Example:
#         2
#     1       3
#                 4
# inorderSuccessor(2, 3)
# Traverse bst in order. Once node equal to x has been reached, return next element in the traversal
# Question: what if x is already the max node? Return None
# Question: Can we have null value nodes? Assume yes
# Q: Can root be None? Assume no
# Q: Is our binary tree a bst? Assume yes
# Q: Are we guaranteed that x is in the bst? Assume yes
# Q: Are we guaranteed that an inorder successor exists? Assume yes

# Idea 1: generate array of sorted nodes. Search through it, and return node right after x. This has complexity O(n)
# Idea 2: We can achieve O(log n) complexity if we search for the item.
# Thereâ€™s no point in recursing left if our node is less than x, and no point in recursing right if our
