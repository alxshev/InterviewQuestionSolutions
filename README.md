# InterviewQuestionSolutions
My solutions to various interview algorithm questions. These are from LeetCode, Cracking the Coding Interview, or other interesting problems I come across.

Each file contains a problem description, as well as my solution followed by a test case.

## Tips
- (most important): After writing your code, take the time to work through an example (do a mental stack trace), and make sure it really works
- When your solution is in a class, don't forget to "self check" after finishing -- a self check is going over the code and making sure that all class variables and methods have a "self." in front of them
- If you get stuck, draw pictures of examples! Can't stress how important this is
- Deal with edge cases (check for null values) at the start of the method
