# InterviewQuestionSolutions
My solutions to various interview algorithm questions. These are from LeetCode, Cracking the Coding Interview, or other interesting problems I come across.

Each file contains a problem description, as well as my solution followed by a test case.

## Tips
- Before writing any code, you MUST work through a couple exmamples. Even if you have the algorithm ready. See how your brain would solve it anyways. You should be doing this during the interview
- "Edge check" - After writing your code, take the time to work your code through 1) a normal example, 2) a more tricky normal example, 3) an edge case (null values or something like that)
- When your solution is in a class, don't forget to "self check" after finishing -- a self check is going over the code and making sure that all class variables and methods have a "self." in front of them
- If you get stuck, draw pictures of examples! Can't stress how important this is
- Deal with edge cases (check for null values) at the start of the method
- Tip: When making recursive calls, always make sure you make them with the right parameters!! Avoid stack overflow infinite recursion
